Alex was in college at a very early age he wound up in medical school and that was all he was an early twenties medical school and the he needed a car he's very good on cars and he needed to buy himself a new car where he got the money from I don't know but he bought a brand new car out on the west coast the red one because I had said to him once said red cars a safer on the road you can't miss seeing them right right and I didn't mean it to be as bright red as he got but anyway he parked it somewhere near home and this is on the west coast near his home in school and somebody rammed into it and dented the door data from my hands that I never thought that they did a good job and I still don't understand how it worked out but he convinced the manufacturers that distribute or whatever that would be cheaper for them to give them a new model car like it than to fix the old one and that's what he got without a nickel
