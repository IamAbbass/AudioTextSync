I would like to tell you a little bit about some things I like and then a little bit about some things I don't like first of all I really enjoy exercising some of my favorite types of exercise are swimming especially in rivers in the country and in big oceans because I like to jump over the waves I also really enjoyed dancing I like dancing to American music because that's what I know best and I also like thousand manning day which are more or less and types of music I also like to walk in the woods and to explore I like to walk through forests and I like to hear rivers I enjoy meeting new people too I like to find out about different ways of life what different people think where they're from and how they live probably one of my favorite things our animals I really love dogs and cats and horses when I was little I always tried to talk my mom into letting me have more animals but usually she wouldn't so I think now that I'm gonna have my own house I try to get lots of animals some things that I don't really like are rude people on sometimes people are not very nice to strangers and that makes me feel bad I also don't really like driving I tend to get pretty bored in the car and it seems like it just takes a long time to get there one final thing I don't really like is waiting sometimes I'm not a very patient person and I just like to hurry things up
